    There are other cameras connected through the same station as this device. One station can only ever stream from one camera at the same time.
    Therefore it is not recommened to use another snapshot method other than cloud snapshots.<p></p>

    <b>Caution!</b> While Force Refresh Snapshots will deliver most up-to-date snapshots, this can have negative effects
    on HomeKit behaviour. For example starting a livestream might be delayed as a side effect by this option.
    See <a href="https://github.com/homebridge-eufy-security/plugin/wiki/Streaming-Settings#streams-take-a-long-time-to-start" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for more informtaion.

  <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert" *ngIf="chargingStatus === 2 && value === 1">
    Since your device is battery powered and currently not charging we don't recommend using this setting. The battery life will most likely decrease significantly.
  </div>

  <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert" *ngIf="chargingStatus === 4 && value === 1">
    Please be advised that since your device is only solar powered we cannot guarantee optimal results with this setting. It might well be, that your battery is depleting faster than it can be recharged by the sun. This depends heavily on your exact use case.

    <b>Description:</b> The plugin will try to get the latest possible snapshot. If none is present the plugin will
    start a livestream to render one frame.<br />
    This process might take a few seconds and can slow down your homebridge instance for this
    duration. If you encounter problems with this method please try another.

    <b>Description:</b> This mode combines the other two. When a snapshot is requested the plugin will try to get
    a new snapshot from the camera.<br>
    After one second the snapshot will be delivered - if necessary by using an older snapshot.
    For events the plugin will wait on a new snapshot.

    <b>Description:</b> The plugin will preferablly use cloud snapshots from eufy to fulfill snapshot requests as
    fast as possible.<br>
    If an event, like motion or doorbell ring oocurs, the plugin will try to wait for a cloud
    snapshot to be provided.
    But the periodic snapshots in homekit will most likely be outdated (e.g. up to a few hours old).
