    Normally it is not encouraged to use live snapshots and the HKSV feature if multiple cameras are connected through one and the same station.
    These options are therefore disabled by default for these devices.
    By enabling this setting you'll be able to use these features anyway, but please be aware that this might result in failing streams.
