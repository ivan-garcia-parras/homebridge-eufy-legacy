    <b>This setting seems only useful if you are able to set the video codec / video compression for the camera
      in the eufy app to 'low' (aka. H264 codec). If you can, we recommened to do so, since there can be a
      significant performance boost (aka. startup of livestreams).</b>

      If enabled local livestreams will be kept alive for a short time after the user stops streaming or a
      snapshot is refreshed (see 'Force Refresh Snapshot' also). This allows subsequent streams to start up much
      faster, but also may increase power consumption for battery powered devices. Additionally a livestream
      will be started (cached) immediately after an event (motion, person, doorbell) occurs, so that start up
      times are decreased.
